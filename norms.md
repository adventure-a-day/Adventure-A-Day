# NORMS for GH-NY-1710 Capstone 'JAKE'
---

#### NORM 1: What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
##### Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
> Majority rules unless there is a tie or someone wants to bring in a third party. Then we will ask a fellow or instructor to help mediate. 


#### NORM 2: What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
##### What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

1. Stepping away: usually frustration is machine-based not human-based, so give yourself some air first 
2. If there is an inter-personal dispute, talk to the person first. 
    - try to understand the problem. Where are they coming from?
    - Offer to pair. 
    - If it's still a problem, talk to a fellow or an instructor
3. Constructive feedback, when positive, is appreciated 


#### NORM 3: What does this group do when we merge our work together?
##### Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
> At least one other person reviews new code. Git master signs off on issues and cleans up the waffle project board. 


#### NORM 4: When does this group ask for help?
##### After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
> Based on how other team members are doing, try pairing first. Two problem solving strategies: explain the problem to your pair, switch the driver/navigator roles. If after 15 min you and the pair can't solve the problem, ask for help from a fellow or instructor. 

#### NORM 5: How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
##### Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?

> Each pair can decide own norms. Make sure to commit and push to maintain accountability on git hub. 

#### NORM 6: How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
##### Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?

> Sit down every evening, and check in about voluntary after hours work to prevent collisions. If there are any expectations to work after hours, explicity talk about it and agree as a group. 


#### NORM 7: What time does this group have daily stand up?
> After lecture is over (10:30am)
